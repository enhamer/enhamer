Thank you for the interest in ENHAMER!

*"A System for Characterisation of Piezoelectric Materials and Associated Electronics for Vibration Powered Energy Harvesting Devices"*




## What is ENHAMER?

**ENHAMER** is a python-based, open-source tool for control over energy harvesting rig.

The design principles of ENHAMER are wide application scope, modularity, and easy extensibility!
